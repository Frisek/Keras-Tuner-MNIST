## Keras-Tuner-MNIST

### Introduction

The Keras Tuner is a powerful tool for hyperparameter tuning in deep learning models. In this project, we explore the application of Keras Tuner to the MNIST problem, which involves classifying handwritten digits.

### Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. There is also a test set of 10,000 images for evaluation. The goal is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify the digits from 0 to 9.


### Model Architecture

We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this problem. The model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The final layer uses softmax activation to output the probability distribution over the classes.


### Hyperparameter Tuning

Using the Keras Tuner, we explore different hyperparameters to optimize the model performance. The hyperparameters include the learning rate, number of convolutional and pooling layers, filter sizes, and dropout rate. We define a search space for each hyperparameter and let the tuner explore different combinations to find the best configuration.


### Tuning Process

Define the search space for each hyperparameter. For example, the learning rate may be searched within the range [0.001, 0.01], and the number of convolutional layers may be chosen from [2, 4, 6].
Configure the tuner with the search space and the desired optimization objective, such as accuracy or loss.
Perform the hyperparameter search using the tuner's search methods, such as random search or Bayesian optimization.
Evaluate each model configuration by training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the validation set.
Select the best model based on the optimization objective and retrain it on the combined training and validation sets.
Finally, evaluate the selected model on the test set to obtain the final performance metrics.
Results
After applying Keras Tuner to the MNIST problem, we achieved a model with an accuracy of 98% on the test set. The optimized hyperparameters included a learning rate of 0.001, 4 convolutional layers, filter sizes of [32, 64, 64, 128], and a dropout rate of 0.25. The tuned model outperformed the initial model with default hyperparameters, which had an accuracy of 96%.


### Conclusion

The Keras Tuner is a valuable tool for automating the process of hyperparameter tuning in deep learning models. By systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameters, we can optimize the model's performance on the MNIST problem. The tuned model achieved superior accuracy compared to the default configuration, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance.
